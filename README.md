# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a git workflow guide on the Github repo for our website for Git Best Practice. Worked on some more React, Material UI and SVG for Civic Tech Toronto Website. Practiced splitting code into folders for better organization and maintainence.

**Thoughts:** Knowing Git is a must for every developer. Just by creating a git workflow by typing it into a list of steps got me thinking hard about what each step of the workflow will do and what to watch out for. Although I am not a fan of writing CSS, I forced myself to polish my CSS and React skill using Material UI to guarantee mobile responsiveness. I also reorganized the folders to make sure all files are well-organized and clean.

### Day 2: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More and more CSS and React!

**Thoughts:** Never know whether or not I will get over the fear of CSS... It's nightmarish to think of CSS, but you gotta do what you gotta do! Go, Khoi!

### Day 3: September 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More intense CSS, a bit of git (read up about `git rebase`). Basically rebasing is quite similar to merge. Rebasing puts all the commit history of a source branch onto a "target" branch and "linearize the entire commit history".. Right now I don't have practical knowledge of what rebasing does yet, but it seems the biggest benefit is to have one linear commit history, which is pretty neat :) as opposed to merge. One thing to keep in mind is ONLY to perform rebase on a private branch that no one but you use.

**Thoughts:** CSS is another monster in of itself... enuff said. Hopefully one day I can get to fully grasph the concept of rebase.
